# algolia-vuejs-example

> Sample app that shows that Algolia can be easily integrated into a Vue.js app

This app is functionally identical to the example presented in the doc of algoliahelper's lib but it has been designed to be integrated in a more complicated app:
* It uses vuex to manage states instead of the eventlistener provided by the lib.
* The .vue logic splits into different files

The app is built from the official webpack template. PR and remarks are welcome!

## Todos

* Style cleaning in the components
* Display product informations (vue-router)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
